## Technical drawings for holder
The holder was machined from aluminium in the student workshop of the Claredon Laboratory at the University of Oxford. It was designed to fit to the tables of a variety of Bruker spectrometers (ElexSys 560/580/680 were tested). Sliding parts are made of stainless steel in order to control abrasion and cut to the right length.
